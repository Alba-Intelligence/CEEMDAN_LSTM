CEEMDAN_LSTM
===
# Background 
CEEMDAN_LSTM is a Python project for decomposition-integration forecasting models based on EMD methods and LSTM. It is a relatively imperfect module but beginners can quickly use it to make a decomposition-integration prediction by `CEEMDAN` (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise [(Torres et al. 2011)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5947265/)) and `LSTM` (Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network [(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6795963)). If you use or refer to the content of this project, please cite paper: "Zhou, F. T. (2021). Carbon price forecasting based on CEEMDAN and LSTM. Unpublished now."

# Install
    First download `CEEMDAN_LSTM.py` to your computer, and create a new file that can run pythonã€‚
    If you can use Jupyter, you can directly download `CEEMDAN LSTM of CarbonPrice.ipynb` at the same time and follow the steps inside to complete the prediction.
