CEEMDAN_LSTM
===
## Background 
CEEMDAN_LSTM is a Python project for decomposition-integration forecasting models based on EMD methods and LSTM. It is a relatively imperfect module but beginners can quickly use it to make a decomposition-integration prediction by `CEEMDAN`, Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise [(Torres et al. 2011)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5947265/), and `LSTM`, Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network [(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6795963). If you use or refer to the content of this project, please cite paper: "Zhou, F. T. (2021). Carbon price forecasting based on CEEMDAN and LSTM. Unpublished now."

## Install
First, download `CEEMDAN_LSTM.py` to your computer, and create a new file that can run python. If you can use Jupyter, you can directly download `CEEMDAN LSTM of CarbonPrice.ipynb` at the same time and follow the steps inside to complete the prediction.

```python
import CEEMDAN_LSTM as cl
```
If an error occurs, please check the modules that need to be installed. Note if the error is that `pyemd` does not exist, please install `EMD-signal` rather than pyemd module.

```python
pip install datetime
pip install EMD-signal # pyemd
pip install vmdpy
pip install sampen
pip install tensorflow==2.5.0
```

## Usage
### 0. Help or Example
You can use the code to call for a guideline or help.

```python
cl.guideline()
cl.example()
```

### 1. Declare the path
Determine the folder to store dataset and the folder to store output results. If it runs successfully, the program will display the picture of the seriesã€‚  
The default dataset saving path: D:\\CEEMDAN_LSTM\\  
The default figures saving path: D:\\CEEMDAN_LSTM\\figures\\  
The default logs and output saving path: D:\\CEEMDAN_LSTM\\subset\\  
The default dataset name: cl_sample_dataset (must be csv file)  
    
```python
series = cl.declare_path()
```
If you want to use anthor folders, you can use `cl.declare_path(path="",figure_path="",log_path="",dataset_name="")` (must be csv file)
If you want to use your own data, you can use `cl.declare_path(series=pd.Series)` (must be pd.Series)
