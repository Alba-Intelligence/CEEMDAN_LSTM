CEEMDAN_LSTM
===
# Background 
  CEEMDAN_LSTM is a Python project for decomposition-integration forecasting models based on EMD methods and LSTM. 
  This is a relatively imperfect module but beginners can quickly use it to make a decomposition-integration prediction.
  If you use or refer to the content of this project, please cite paper:
  "Zhou, F. T. (2021). Carbon price forecasting based on CEEMDAN and LSTM. Unpublished now."

# Flowchart

# Install
  First download `CEEMDAN_LSTM.py` to your computer, and create a new file that can run pythonã€‚
  If you can use Jupyter, you can directly download `CEEMDAN LSTM of CarbonPrice.ipynb` at the same time and follow the steps inside to complete the prediction.
